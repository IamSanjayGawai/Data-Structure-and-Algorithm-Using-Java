Nth Fibonacci Number
Send Feedback
Nth term of Fibonacci series F(n), where F(n) is a function, is calculated using the following formula -
    F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), 
    Where, F(1) =  1, 
           F(2) = 1
Provided N you have to find out the Nth Fibonacci Number.
Input Format :
The first line of each test case contains a real number ‘N’.
Output Format :
For each test case, return its equivalent Fibonacci number.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10000     
Where ‘N’ represents the number for which we have to find its equivalent Fibonacci number.

Time Limit: 1 second
Sample Input 1:
6
Sample Output 1:
8
Explanation of Sample Input 1:
Now the number is ‘6’ so we have to find the “6th” Fibonacci number
So by using the property of the Fibonacci series i.e 

[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21]
So the “6th” element is “8” hence we get the output.

	    int n=sc.nextInt();
		
    

        int number_1 = 0, number_2 = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        {
            int number_3 = number_1 + number_2;
            number_1 = number_2;
            number_2 = number_3;	

			// finding the Nth number by matching with i
            if(i==n)
            {
            	System.out.print(number_1);
            }
