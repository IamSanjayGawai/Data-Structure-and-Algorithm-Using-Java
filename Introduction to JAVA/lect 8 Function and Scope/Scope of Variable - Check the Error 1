Will following code generate any error ?


public class Main {
    public static void func(int a) {
        int b = a;
        b = b + 10;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        func(a);
        System.out.println(b);
    }
}


Ans: Yes

Note: ####Code will generate error as we are trying to print value of variable b in main and there isn't any variable b created or accessible in main. 
Variable b in the code is created inside function _func_ and is local to this function and not accessible outside it.
